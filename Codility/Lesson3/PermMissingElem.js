/*
An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

int solution(int A[], int N);

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
the elements of A are all distinct;
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

function solution(A) {
  // write your code in JavaScript (Node.js 8.9.4)
  var temp = 0;
  var hab = A.length + 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    hab = hab + (i + 1);
    temp += A[i];
  }
  return hab - temp;
